these are notes on testing different parameters of the Skeletron python script developed by Mike Migurski at Stamen.

standard input to run the script in bash looks like this:
   
   for route-rels script;
      python skeletron-osm-route-rels.py /Users/chrishenrick/Projects/Beijing/DATA/skeletron_test/osm.xml/beijing.osm /Users/chrishenrick/Projects/Beijing/DATA/skeletron_test/json/beijing-routes_z15_w20.json 
      
   
   for streets script:
      python skeletron-osm-streets.py ~/Projects/Beijing/DATA/skeletron_test/osm.xml/beijing.osm /Users/chrishenrick/Projects/Beijing/DATA/skeletron_test/json/beijing-streets_z15.json 


   *note: don't set the paramater to ignore highway class / type as it ditches the road classification tag / field.
      the road lines can be joined later in AI using name and highway fields.
      
   *to set the width and zoom parameters use -z and -w after python skeletron-osm-etc.py 

   
For the exact scales associated with zoom levels (-z) see: http://kelsocartography.com/blog/?p=2407
   -z 19 is the most zoomed in (~1:1,000) while -z 14 is ~1:36,000 and -z 4 is ~1:37,000,000

the width parameter appears to contribute to generalization, eg: a width of 15 will be more generalized than the default value of 10.

  

*****************tests**************************

a zoom level of 1 caused an error in the script:

   *but this was for a metro extract size of data, probably to be expected.
   
************************************************
   
-the streets script seems to have better results than the routes-rels script, but returns all types of streets. 
   the geojson data can be queried in QGIS to only display types of roads desired for simplification 
   (ie: motorways, primary, etc.)
   
-For Avalon maps setting the zoom level to around 15 or 13 seems to generate good results (z15 is ~1:18,000 and z13 is ~1:72,000)

-increasing the width parameter > than the default value of 10 for smaler scale zoom levels seems like a good idea?
