*note: use ogrinfo to get stats and ogr2ogr to create a new shapefile.

#return all values for a field
ogrinfo -sql "SELECT DISTINCT field_name FROM polylayer" polylayer.shp

#this command queries all admin 0 capitals (country capitals) and creates a new shapefile called 'ne_50m_pop_place_admin0_cap.shp':
  ogr2ogr -sql "SELECT * FROM ne_50m_populated_places_simple WHERE featurecla='Admin-0 capital'"  ne_50m_pop_place_admin0_cap.shp ne_50m_populated_places_simple.shp

#similar as above but returns a new shapefile only of admin 1 capitals 
  ogr2ogr -sql "SELECT * FROM ne_50m_populated_places_simple WHERE featurecla IN ('Admin-1 capital', 'Admin-1 region capital')"  ne_50m_pop_place_admin1_cap.shp ne_50m_populated_places_simple.shp

#this query returns each value in the featurecla field with no duplicates and does not create a new shapefile:
  ogrinfo -sql "select DISTINCT featurecla from ne_50m_populated_places_simple"  ne_50m_populated_places_simple.shp ne_50m_populated_places_simple
  
#this query returns the number of values in ADMO_A3 without duplicate values:
  ogrinfo -sql "select COUNT(DISTINCT ADM0_A3) from ne_50m_populated_places_simple"  ne_50m_populated_places_simple.shp ne_50m_populated_places_simple

Working with OSM shapefile extract data

#return the attributes in the type field and order them alphabetically:
ogrinfo -sql "select distinct type from roads order by type" roads.shp roads

The following commands are for separating roads into various classes for the Moon HB regional road styles:
  To Do: create a shell script that runs these commands. 
=======
#I wrote the following commands for separating an OSM extract roads.shp containing every type of OSM road style into different classes for the ATP Moon HB regional road style:

  To Do: create a bash shell script that runs all of these commands.

  *note: being able to perform the 'group by' function in ogr sql would be helpful for joining road geometry based on field names,
         ie: ogr2ogr -sql "select * from roads group by ('name', 'type', 'ref')" roads_grouped.shp roads.shp 
         but ogr sql does not support the 'group by' SQL aggregation command.
         apparently this is possible in postgresql with postGIS, then one could export the table result to a .shp format.
